## Vanthampurs toppled. Off to Elturel and Avernus
<details>
  <summary>Leaving Baldur's Gate and getting into Hell.</summary>

* Headed to Candlekeep to find more information on the puzzle box and shield.
* Sylvira was indeed helpful in helping open the puzzle box and pointing us to help reaching Avernus.
* Headed to Soaring Citadel to get transpo from the asshat Traxigor
* Gated through to Avernus with Reya and Lulu in tow, abandoned by Traxigor
* Saved Harkina Hunt +2 from snake beards.
* Saved Shorah from a ghastly fate.
* Safely made it to Torm’s Cathedral, and left the civilians in a storage cellar with Reya.
* Got a bad case of the crabs, but made it through that.
* Lulu recalls the last thing Zarial said to her: "This is who I am now," Zariel told Lulu. "When demons die, they cry out _my_ name in terror."
* Lulu recalls travelling to Avernus and a place called the Wandering Emporium and a friend there named Mahadi.
* Found Seltern Obranch, a doubting druid who was feigning death, and brought him to the other Civies.
* Found a Narzugon had come for the Civvies and Reya tried to give an arm and a leg to save them, but the demon only took the leg… and the Civies.
* Reya is very distraught, tried to cheer her up.
* Saved Orin Ragron from some devils, but he proved to be cowardly and ran away.
* Found the Narzugon and fought him off, but was too late for Harkina. We vow we will keep looking for the children…
* Found Trevick Thntorme, a hall guard who’s spirits I saved.
* Reya is still very distraught, tried to cheer her up again

* Yeenoghu hid the temple by making a great bloody scab swallow the palace and demon.
* Lulu also remembers wandering Avernus after and getting help from Chukka and Clonk at Ft. Knucklebone.
</details>

## Deeper into hell.
* As we prepared to go deeper, we all seemed to be plagued by hellish nightmares.
* Sidenote: multiple people’s dreams seemed to feature Jon…
* Jumped off Elturel and landed safely in Avernus thanks to me.
* Map started talking at this point
* Note in margin: turns out it won’t shut up.
* Made it to Ft Knucklebone. Chukka and Clonk are useless, but they did point us to Mad Maggie who was “helpful”.
* Performed dogooderness for everyone at the fort.
* Sidenote: need to watch Jon as he seems to be casting aside Eldath in favor of an evil animated skull.
* Pushed into Lulu’s subconscious via Mad Maggie’s spell:
* First saved some wounded celestials from some devils. This is clearly analogous to the fight against the devils originally with Zariel.
* Next we found sludge begin rising around us filling us with loss and grief. This was likely representative of the scab rising to hide the sword.
* Finally Lulu was presented with a spyglass which showed her where the sword was.
* Next we went into my expansive, impressive, awe-inspiring mind:
* First saw me gambling. This makes sense as random chance makes up all things and I have always loved to navigate the randomness… and make wagers.
* Next was reminded that in order to pay off a debt, I had agreed to perform a ritual. Was promised nobody would be harmed, but now I’m wondering.
* The final scene showed that the ritual centered around Jon. Was left with the question: How do you erase a debt, a man, and a memory all at once?
* Left Ft. Knucklebone in our very own Demon Grinder.
* Not far out we found a second Demon Grinder which I commandeered, with some help, from Raggadragga.
* Found some devils being jerks near an abyssal chicken spawning site.
* Chased them off and brought Krikendolt, the nice one albeit injured one, and his friend, Earwax the abyssal chicken, with us.
* Went to a magic tower where we met Mordenkainen!
* Yes, THAT Mordenkainen!
* Mordenkainen directed us to a mage’s tower, but on the way we found an encampment of hobgoblins and a devil. They had several war machines and a captive (either demon or tiefling).
* Made a plan that will surely lead to the successful rescue of the war machines, and maybe the captive. Off we go…
* Found some devils tormenting a tiefling, so naturally we rescued him. We will save every soul in Hell if we can.
* Azilius will be joining us for a bit, he may be able to help us find/navigate the Wandering Emporium.
* Tried to help a man by touching his stones. Turned out to not be a good idea. Everyone felt the touch of magic. Oh and the man was not a man, but a demon, Ubbalux, imprisoned by the stones by Bel.
* Left Krikendolt and Earwax with him saying we’d return once Lulu got what she needed. He wanted us to ask Mephistopheles to free him at some mirror.
* Found the most metal trees I’ve ever seen! They held tormented angels, which we couldn’t truly free. Got stung for trying.
* Fought the damn narzugon again. He presumed to pass judgement on us! He turned tail and ran again. Coward…
* During the fracas Lulu was taken by a wasp. Followed her to a wasp nest.
* Invaded the wasp nest, killing many wasps, including the queen.
* Jon summoned another god’s guardian during this…
* Brought the nest burning to the ground.
* Met a helpful stranger, Ivor Bodkin, who is going to help us find the children (Ezo/Brask) we lost in Elturel.
* Learned a potion recipe from Tur (Dr pepper, cherry liquor, dark rum, vanilla bean whipped topping)
* Went into Haruman’s, that F’n narzugon’s, dungeon.
* Many demons found their end.
* Found the twins in Haruman’s compound.
* Ivor is a two-faced asshole, stole the kids and teleported away.
* Leaving dejectedly, and retracing our steps we found the mirror of mephistar.
* Made a deal with the devil, and dammed the styx in exchange for knowledge and power (pretty standard stuff really.)
* Saved a devil who taught us how to make a snot-munculus.
* Kradian stood guard as everyone else had a Meph-nap.
* Got a lead on our next stop, the Bone Brambles.
* At the brambles Ralzala, a dao (isn’t that Tur’s zen ki or something), asked us to bargain from Red Ruth for their freedom.
* In the brambles we fought some dirt piles, and some little tree people and spirits.
* Red Ruth offered to help with the dao, but only if we got her a spa getaway at the Emporium, which would stop next at the tower of power.
* Met some devils at the tower pad, who wanted a hand of glory or something.
* Met Mahadi at the Emporium who was surprised pleased to see both Azilius and Lulu again.
* Mahadi gave some free samples, and offered some bad deals. But we were able to make Red Ruth’s appointment.
